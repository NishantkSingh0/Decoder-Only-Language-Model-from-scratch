# Overview
This repository contains a custom-built language model trained on 50,000 carefully curated paragraphs. The model architecture is based on the Transformer decoder, incorporating multiple layers of attention mechanisms, pointwise feed-forward networks, and advanced tokenization techniques such as Byte Pair Encoding (BPE). The model was designed to process sequences of 300 tokens, with an emphasis on handling large vocabularies and ensuring optimal training using a warmup learning rate schedule. Below, we delve into the details of the model architecture, dataset preparation, and the training process.
